# Day 06 - Factorial Calculator

This Java project demonstrates two methods for calculating the factorial of a number:

1. **Recursive approach**
2. **Iterative approach**

## 🔢 What is a Factorial?

The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

Example:  
`5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`
