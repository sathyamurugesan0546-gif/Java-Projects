# Day 28 - Anagram Checker

## 📌 Description
The **Anagram Checker** is a simple Java program that checks whether two given strings are **anagrams** of each other.  
An **anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.  

**Example:**  
- `"listen"` and `"silent"` → Anagram  
- `"hello"` and `"world"` → Not Anagram  

---

## ✅ Features
- Accepts **two strings** as input from the user.
- Ignores **case sensitivity**.
- Handles **white spaces** (multi-word anagrams supported).
- Displays whether the strings are **Anagrams** or **Not Anagrams**.

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Strings
- Arrays
- Sorting
- Scanner (for user input)
- String manipulation (`replaceAll`, `toLowerCase`)

---

## ▶ How to Run

1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
2. Run the Program
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

---

## ▶️ Sample Output

Enter first string: Listen
Enter second string: Silent
The strings are Anagrams.
