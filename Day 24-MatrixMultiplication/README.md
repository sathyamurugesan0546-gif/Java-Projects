# Day 24 – Matrix Multiplication

## 📌 Project Overview

This Java program multiplies two matrices entered by the user.  
It checks whether multiplication is possible and outputs the resulting matrix.

---

## ✅ Features 

- Accepts dimensions and elements of two matrices.
- Checks if multiplication is possible.
- Performs matrix multiplication using nested loops.
- Displays the resulting matrix neatly.

---

## 🛠 Concepts Used

- 2D Arrays
- Nested Loops
- User Input (Scanner)
- Conditional Statements

---

## ▶ How to Run

1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
2. Run the Program
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

## 📌 Sample Output

Enter rows of first matrix: 2
Enter columns of first matrix: 3
Enter rows of second matrix: 3
Enter columns of second matrix: 2

Enter elements of first matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6

Enter elements of second matrix:
7 8
9 10
11 12

Resulting Matrix:
58 64
139 154
